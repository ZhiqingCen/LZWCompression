# Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW)

- Development of LZW Encoder and Decoder:
  - Implemented an LZW encoder and decoder in C++ supporting 15-bit dictionary entries with a maximum of 32,768 entries.
  - Utilized efficient bit operations to handle the compression and decompression processes.
- Data Structure and Algorithm Expertise:
  - Enhanced understanding of the LZW algorithm through practical implementation and optimization.
- Bit Operations Proficiency:
  - Practiced advanced bit manipulation techniques to encode and decode data, ensuring efficient use of memory and processing power.
  - Managed 15-bit dictionary entries accurately within the constraints of the C++ language.
- Testing and Validation:
  - Conducted extensive testing to ensure the encoder and decoder worked correctly and efficiently across various data sets.
  - Verified the integrity and performance of the compressed and decompressed data, maintaining the fidelity of the original information.
